# HTML and CSS Projects
This repository contains several single page static websites. I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and limited Javascript to style these pages.
## [Spongebob Squarepants Fansite](https://github.com/dhavap/HTML_CSSProjects/tree/master/SpongebobFansite)
This is a fan site that contains a section on characters from the cartoon as well as a subscription form. The characters are represented by Bootstrap cards organised into Masonry-like columns. They are also linked to an external profile of the character on hero.fandom.com. In future, I plan to scrape relevant content from that site and render it on my own customised html pages instead. Key features of this one page site include the onscroll function that makes the navbar stick to the top and a "to top" button appears when the user scrolls down, as well as dynamically updating the year in the footer using Javascript.

## [Cinema](https://github.com/dhavap/HTML_CSSProjects/tree/master/bootstrap4_project)
This is a one-page site created for a hypothetical cinema. Current movies are displayed along with their timings. Technologies used for this project include Bootstrap.
