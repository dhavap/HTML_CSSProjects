# HTML and CSS Projects
This repository contains several single page static websites. I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and limited Javascript to style these pages.
## [Spongebob Squarepants Fansite](https://github.com/dhavap/HTML_CSSProjects/tree/master/SpongebobFansite)
This is a fan site that contains a section on characters from the cartoon as well as a subscription form. The characters are represented by Bootstrap cards organised into Masonry-like columns. They are also linked to an external profile of the character on hero.fandom.com. In future, I plan to scrape relevant content from that site and render it on my own customised html pages instead. 

### Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

### Key features
- Onscroll function that makes the navbar stick to the top 
- "To top" button appears when the user scrolls down
- Year is dynamically updated in the footer using Javascript.  

### Future plans
- React-ify the site
- Scrape data for information about different characters
